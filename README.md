Recurrent neural networks have proved as one of the most powerful models for processing sequential data(like stock price prediction data where on basis of some previous data we try to predict the next instance data).Long Short-Term memory is one of the most successful RNNs architectures.
LSTM introduces the memory cell, a unit of computation that replaces traditional artificial neurons in the hidden layer of the network. With these memory cells, networks are able to effectively associate memories and input remote in time, hence suit to grasp the structure of data dynamically over time with high prediction capacity.Basically in a LSTM we have forget gate layer, update gate layer which help in forgetting data and updating data in the current cell state(cell state is responsible for maintaining the memory that might be needed in future).All these contribute in predicting the next data taking into consideration the previous data from past time stamps.
